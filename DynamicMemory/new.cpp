  cout << *intPtr << endl; // Outputs non-sense (maybe 0, maybe not)

  //delete intPtr;
  // It doesn't work if we incremented the memory address because
  //    if so, we altered the memory address of where intPtr was
  //    pointing, and that new memory is not ours to free.
  //    So, because we can't delete it, we end up with a memory leak.
  // If we did just increment the value of the int it's pointing to,
  //    then we would want to delete intPtr
